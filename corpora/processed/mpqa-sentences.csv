21.00.52-4729,20020111,6,1907,1956,49.0,8.0,The CDU chose him because it believes in victory.

21.05.06-7601,20020111,4,5911,6028,117.0,3.0,Hence a broad social debate on who should contribute how much to realizing the Kyoto standards is urgently necessary.

21.05.06-7601,20020111,7,782,957,175.0,5.0,"However, no broad social debate has yet been conducted on the crucial question: How much should each sector or target group contribute to achieving the Belgian Kyoto standard?"

21.05.06-7601,20020111,12,5032,5224,192.0,0.0,Fourth is the contrast between the benchmark covenants' relative emissions standards and the Belgian Government's absolute restrictions on emissions within the framework of the Kyoto protocol.
21.05.06-7601,20020111,13,6316,6539,223.0,3.0,This European proposal assumes absolute restrictions on emissions (companies obtain rights to emit a certain number of tons of carbon dioxide) and is hence irreconcilable at first sight with the Flemish benchmark covenants.
21.05.06-7601,20020111,14,3454,3643,189.0,3.0,A cost-efficient division of efforts implies that each sector must limit its emissions to the point at which the additional costs for one extra ton of reduction are the same in all sectors.

21.05.06-7601,20020111,16,3268,3447,179.0,1.0,But benchmarking is not sufficient from the viewpoint of economic efficiency (realizing the Kyoto restrictions on emissions at the lowest possible costs for the whole of society).
21.05.06-7601,20020111,17,468,620,152.0,2.0,This implies -- whether or not one agrees with it -- that the Kyoto protocol will become binding for all of this country's inhabitants and institutions.

21.05.06-7601,20020111,19,2191,2423,232.0,3.0,Belgian industry is advocating benchmark covenants because it is afraid that an absolute limit would weaken considerably its competitive position with respect to similar companies in regions where the Kyoto protocol is not ratified.

21.05.06-7601,20020111,21,6653,6816,163.0,2.0,"Companies could be allocated rights on the basis of an energy efficiency standard, on the condition that they are prepared to accept an absolute emissions ceiling."
21.05.06-7601,20020111,22,5225,5490,265.0,4.0,"Since industry does not wish to let itself be pinned down on an absolute emissions ceiling, while the government feels itself committed to an absolute ceiling, industry is foisting the necessary efforts onto other sectors in society through the benchmark covenants."
21.05.06-7601,20020111,23,6540,6652,112.0,2.0,"However, the benchmark covenants could be opportune here for settling the initial allocation of emission rights."
21.05.06-7601,20020111,24,2518,2785,267.0,4.0,"However, this disregards the fact that arguments other than purely financial ones also play a part in the location decisions of companies in our region (favorable location near seaports, availability of know-how, well-educated personnel, stable political climate...)."
21.05.06-7601,20020111,25,1312,1522,210.0,2.0,"That is strikingly illustrated by Belgian large-scale industry, which has made great efforts over the past 10 years, over which energy intensity (energy use per unit of final product) has improved considerably."
21.05.06-7601,20020111,26,1815,1931,116.0,0.0,"In a nutshell, benchmarking means that companies compare their energy efficiency with that of similar plants abroad."
21.05.06-7601,20020111,27,7198,7347,149.0,1.0,"By using the benchmark covenants to allocate emission rights initially, the good points of covenants are retained and their drawbacks are eliminated."
21.05.06-7601,20020111,28,5712,5910,198.0,3.0,"Thus the benchmark covenants could have very significant consequences for other sectors and target groups in our society, whereas the latter are not involved in the deliberations on those covenants."
21.05.06-7601,20020111,29,2,158,156.0,0.0,The federal and local authorities are currently preparing the ratification of the Kyoto international protocol on limiting the emission of greenhouse gases.

21.05.06-7601,20020111,32,4447,4518,71.0,0.0,"In that way, less energy-intensive products enjoy a relative advantage."
21.05.06-7601,20020111,33,6035,6140,105.0,2.0,"Despite these shortcomings, we believe that a role is reserved for the instrument of benchmark covenants."
21.05.06-7601,20020111,34,3644,3840,196.0,1.0,"As a result, the costs of additional restrictions on emissions in industry must be compared with those of other sectors, such as the transport sector, households, the service sector, and so forth."
21.05.06-7601,20020111,35,4525,4627,102.0,1.0,"Third, questions can be asked about the emission restrictions that would be achieved by the covenants."
21.05.06-7601,20020111,36,4010,4253,243.0,1.0,"Second, benchmark covenants do not guarantee that the external climate costs of energy use (the increased greenhouse effect caused by the burning of fossil fuels) are correctly taken into account in the final products of the sectors concerned."

20.36.59-7133,20020320,36,4748,4894,146.0,0.0,This principle means that the burden of proof that the claimant state has suffered damages does not lie on the state submitting its damages claim.

20.36.59-7133,20020320,41,6966,7136,170.0,7.0,"Meaning that rather than challenging and issuing objections to the Australian space project, Indonesia should take advantage of our southern neighbour's space activities."
20.36.59-7133,20020320,42,8256,8459,203.0,6.0,"Australia should adhere to the Cardinal Principle of International Law, which states that all nations in the world must first respect and promote the humanitarian interests and progress of all humankind."

20.36.59-7133,20020320,48,4895,5106,211.0,0.0,It is sufficient at law to demonstrate the fact of the damage caused as a result of the space object identified as belonging to the launching state or a state that has participated in the space object launching.
20.36.59-7133,20020320,49,3186,3327,141.0,0.0,The Convention also sets out various claims that can be made by states who have suffered damages as a result of other states' space projects.
20.36.59-7133,20020320,50,7613,7705,92.0,2.0,"""Australia is not allowed to prevent other states who want to cooperate on its space centre."
20.36.59-7133,20020320,51,1697,1852,155.0,5.0,Even more worrying is the possibility that a space station could be transformed into a military base and pose a threat to Indonesia's national sovereignty.

21.37.20-19607,20020418,1,2287,2581,294.0,14.0,"Most importantly, however, these criminals will have the largest illusion if they imagine that they have succeeded in liquidating the intifadah and destroying its infrastructure after having succeeded in liquidating or arresting a small or large number of the intifadah's leaders and strugglers"
21.37.20-19607,20020418,2,364,605,241.0,15.0,"In addition, they seek to convince other parties of these two ideas and are waiting for the concerned parties to agree to them, or, at least, to the first one, after which these two administrations will set their own conditions at the table."
21.37.20-19607,20020418,3,2174,2280,106.0,6.0,This reconstruction will take place more quickly than what the criminals in Tel Aviv and Washington think.

21.37.20-19607,20020418,6,1398,1581,183.0,13.0,It is thus an illusion for these criminal administrations to imagine that they have triumphed and that they are now in a position to dictate their own conditions on this great people.
21.37.20-19607,20020418,7,3460,3778,318.0,19.0,"The conclusion to which we come is that the Zionist and US administrations have aggravated the Zionist entity's historical impasse through the crime they have committed together when they had the illusion that ""force"" can break the Palestinian people's will and impose on this people what other means failed to impose."
21.37.20-19607,20020418,8,2843,2948,105.0,10.0,"These criminals know this fact, as much as we, the Arabs, do, because they are in direct contact with it."

21.37.20-19607,20020418,14,3072,3292,220.0,6.0,"As has been acknowledged by Uri Avneri, a veteran Zionist writer, the intifadah's structure ""exists within millions of Palestinians and also within tens of millions of Arabs in whose chests the fire of anger is blazing."""

21.37.20-19607,20020418,18,4103,4328,225.0,8.0,"Millions of Arabs, Palestinians and non-Palestinians alike, now have a conviction stronger than before to the effect that it is impossible to achieve ""coexistence"" with this usurping, occupying, aggressive, and racist entity."
21.37.20-19607,20020418,19,2583,2842,259.0,7.0,Another deep-rooted fact is that the organizations of the Palestinian resistance still preserve their organizational structure and are also characterized by their superb ability to renew their leaders and replace the ones who fall along the path of martyrdom.
21.37.20-19607,20020418,20,3785,4102,317.0,21.0,"Contrary to the visible scene and to the illusion of Sharon and Bush, this Zionist-US crime has confirmed that the Zionist entity's historical impasse is constantly aggravating and that ""the Arabs' recognition of this entity's right to exist"" is now more distant than before despite some official Arab ""recognitions."""

21.45.32-26215,20020418,2,2299,2548,249.0,12.0,"It would be entirely improper if, in its defense of Israel, the United States continues to exert pressure on neighboring Arab countries, such as, Syria and Lebanon, which have been accused of supporting terrorist organizations, such as the Hezbolah."
21.45.32-26215,20020418,3,568,836,268.0,10.0,"But the current development of events, that is, the standstill situation, makes it clear that US foreign policy has been put to a very serious test in which the United States needs to discipline its decades-long ally, Israel, and not ruin its relations with the Arabs."

ReidSandra,ula,28,10212,10222,10.0,2.0,Thank you.
ReidSandra,ula,29,6667,6715,48.0,3.0,And he told me I would have to write this paper.
ReidSandra,ula,30,3226,3299,73.0,0.0,I'd like to tell you about how I got into becoming a teacher's assistant.
ReidSandra,ula,31,1344,1385,41.0,3.0,Just anything to get out of doing my job.
ReidSandra,ula,32,6396,6492,96.0,0.0,"A few years later, um, I had the opportunity to apply for a scholarship to further my education."

ReidSandra,ula,35,1603,1635,32.0,0.0,So she began to tell this story.
ReidSandra,ula,36,3931,4044,113.0,4.0,"So that night I went home and I asked my mother about it and she said, ""Baby, I really want you to go to college."
ReidSandra,ula,37,146,187,41.0,0.0,During our young years we were very poor.
ReidSandra,ula,38,7081,7137,56.0,5.0,"I don't, just so I can work in the school I'll be happy."
ReidSandra,ula,39,8097,8150,53.0,0.0,And they hired a sub but the sub didn't do that much.
ReidSandra,ula,40,9584,9624,40.0,0.0,And why did the other school close down?
ReidSandra,ula,41,1068,1133,65.0,2.0,So one night my mother asked me to go inside and wash the dishes.
ReidSandra,ula,42,4548,4588,40.0,0.0,So I never got a chance to go to school.
ReidSandra,ula,43,3447,3561,114.0,0.0,"As I told you, in the past we were a very poor family and I never got the chance to go to college because of this."
ReidSandra,ula,44,4648,4679,31.0,0.0,"Yes, my brother went to school."
ReidSandra,ula,45,7264,7377,113.0,2.0,"Out of 150 assistants who had applied for this grant only 16 got the opportunity, so I felt very proud of myself."
ReidSandra,ula,46,3571,3757,186.0,5.0,"Uh, while I was in high school a teacher of mine noticed that I had an extra bone in my foot and she said, ""Well now Sandra we can use this as get toward, on your grant to go to college."
ReidSandra,ula,47,1714,1899,185.0,4.0,"And the mother asked the little girl to please go in and wash the dishes so that she could go to bed early and not come up, wake up in the morning and see all those dishes on the table."
ReidSandra,ula,48,8547,8638,91.0,3.0,"I just got to a certain age and I said, ""No I can't do this anymore,"" so I never went back."
ReidSandra,ula,49,10168,10188,20.0,2.0,All right thank you.
ReidSandra,ula,50,2571,2667,96.0,0.0,All of a sudden the butcher knife came out of the drawer and it began to roll around in the air.
ReidSandra,ula,51,1989,2005,16.0,2.0,I don't want to.
ReidSandra,ula,52,2401,2472,71.0,3.0,"So the little girl just said, ""OK I'll go in there and wash the dishes."
ReidSandra,ula,53,5972,6101,129.0,2.0,"After a while, the principal said, ""I would like for you to bring me your, um, transcript so I can see what your grades are like."
ReidSandra,ula,54,2937,2994,57.0,2.0,"Now that knife, when I went to sleep it really scared me."
ReidSandra,ula,55,6246,6285,39.0,4.0,"Um, my dream, my prayers were answered."
ReidSandra,ula,56,5667,5740,73.0,0.0,So they told me about some classes that I could take at Central Piedmont.
ReidSandra,ula,57,6144,6160,16.0,0.0,I did very well.
ReidSandra,ula,58,2053,2071,18.0,2.0,I don't feel good.
ReidSandra,ula,59,9697,10006,309.0,9.0,"Um, that, I really don't know why they closed that school down because it was a really nice school and everything, but they eventually tore it down because I was there I think the first year I went there was the year they built a really nice gym, and I don't think they used that gym no more than three years."
ReidSandra,ula,60,5793,5813,20.0,2.0,I was really afraid.
ReidSandra,ula,61,4940,5026,86.0,0.0,I had another sister who went to Gaston College where she got a business degree there.
ReidSandra,ula,62,4689,4858,169.0,0.0,"He went to Livingstone and then to transferred to Johnson C. Smith, so to make it easier on my mom, to, as far as, you know, him staying at home and going to school too."
ReidSandra,ula,63,7387,7470,83.0,2.0,"So I went on and took the courses, and as I started I think I was taking economics."
ReidSandra,ula,64,5139,5334,195.0,4.0,"Um, I remember once, when I was working in a mill, and I was spinning yarn, and I was saying to myself, and, I was praying actually, and I said, ""God, one day I want to work in the school system."
ReidSandra,ula,65,8832,8869,37.0,0.0,"I've only worked at two, two schools."
ReidSandra,ula,66,7232,7254,22.0,2.0,I couldn't believe it.
ReidSandra,ula,67,4382,4538,156.0,5.0,I sat there and I cried but I tried to be as understanding as possible because I knew my mother struggled really hard to even keep food on the table for us.
ReidSandra,ula,68,5422,5620,198.0,4.0,"As the years went by my prayer was answered and I got the chance to work in the cafeteria as a cashier and the principal there came up to me and said, ""Have you considered being a teacher assistant?"
ReidSandra,ula,69,8963,9061,98.0,0.0,"So I was in those situations where I first, come first, transfer last, come first to transfer out."
ReidSandra,ula,70,9385,9550,165.0,6.0,"If I'm not mistaken I think I've been at Berryhill for I think 17 years, 17, 18 years I've been here at Berryhill so and I hope I never have to leave until I retire."
ReidSandra,ula,71,4124,4277,153.0,3.0,But because there are so many children in the family there are other things you're going to have to have to go to school and I just don't have the money.

sw2015-ms98-a-trans,ula,18,2985,3248,263.0,0.0,uh but they still come up to the front door and uh you know walk around so usually what i do is i'll call the apartment manager and tell him hey there's people coming around you know and they're trying to sell something or or they're from a religious organization
sw2015-ms98-a-trans,ula,19,4856,4978,122.0,4.0,and wanting to uh you know to try and get me to join or you know become interested in their religion because i have my own

sw2015-ms98-a-trans,ula,21,468,525,57.0,2.0,that was the big one i'm talking about i work weird hours
sw2015-ms98-a-trans,ula,22,3775,3809,34.0,2.0,now i agree with their right to um
sw2015-ms98-a-trans,ula,23,1558,1564,6.0,0.0,uh-huh
sw2015-ms98-a-trans,ula,24,5186,5391,205.0,8.0,i don't know how much clearer it can be it's a red sign with silver letters saying no soliciting i should have guessed i guess i should make another one that says religious or otherwise because i still get
sw2015-ms98-a-trans,ula,25,4137,4379,242.0,10.0,yeah yeah no i i agree with you there though i mean they want to choose that particular religion then that's fine with me too you know as long as they don't try and pull me in and drag me in and and i don't like the way that they do it either
sw2015-ms98-a-trans,ula,26,621,634,13.0,0.0,uh-huh uh-huh
sw2015-ms98-a-trans,ula,27,403,410,7.0,2.0,yes yes
sw2015-ms98-a-trans,ula,28,2767,2780,13.0,0.0,um-hum um-hum
sw2015-ms98-a-trans,ula,29,5602,5715,113.0,4.0,but you know i don't think that that would stop people i mean it's like they they see that word and it says uh go
sw2015-ms98-a-trans,ula,30,41,164,123.0,0.0,have you ever got one of those calls that's either generated by a computer or somebody going down a list and they're either
sw2015-ms98-a-trans,ula,31,6168,6216,48.0,2.0,i believe we've pretty much summed everything up
sw2015-ms98-a-trans,ula,32,193,245,52.0,0.0,they're introducing some new product in the area and
sw2015-ms98-a-trans,ula,33,3595,3765,170.0,4.0,and uh i've read a lot about uh that particular sect and i don't particularly care for it so i especially don't like for them to come up to my door and try and talk to me
sw2015-ms98-a-trans,ula,34,852,986,134.0,2.0,or you hear somebody already starting reading reading off a list of stuff that they've read probably a thousand times that day already
sw2015-ms98-a-trans,ula,35,5984,5991,7.0,2.0,oh gosh
sw2015-ms98-a-trans,ula,36,1288,1489,201.0,2.0,uh-huh uh-huh yeah sometimes i i get them on my uh answering machine at home so and i hate that when i've got a whole bunch of messages and i go through them and most of them aren't from anybody at all
sw2015-ms98-a-trans,ula,37,836,842,6.0,0.0,um-hum
sw2015-ms98-a-trans,ula,38,1673,1814,141.0,6.0,i think a law should be passed to where any of these people i think it's great that you know freedom of speech in this country and everything
sw2015-ms98-a-trans,ula,39,6732,6788,56.0,2.0,uh pretty close to it well i've enjoyed talking with you
sw2015-ms98-a-trans,ula,40,6485,6636,151.0,3.0,and i thought yeah that that kind of touched a nerve right there but we got uh we got to talking about the um uh people coming to you at the front door
sw2015-ms98-a-trans,ula,41,6329,6445,116.0,0.0,you talked about the telephone calls people coming and soliciting selling things at the door you said something else
sw2015-ms98-a-trans,ula,42,6067,6089,22.0,2.0,a harassment in itself
sw2015-ms98-a-trans,ula,43,1165,1190,25.0,2.0,even had some of them the
sw2015-ms98-a-trans,ula,44,529,611,82.0,3.0,and invariably just about the time i'm going to sleep the phone tears off the wall
sw2015-ms98-a-trans,ula,45,2784,2981,197.0,4.0,yeah that's true living in an apartment complex though you know you can't um you can't really stop those people from coming around even though they put up signs out front that says no solicitations
sw2015-ms98-a-trans,ula,46,2353,2402,49.0,2.0,i agree with you on that particular subject there
sw2015-ms98-a-trans,ula,47,6904,6919,15.0,2.0,okay thanks bye
sw2015-ms98-a-trans,ula,48,6814,6853,39.0,2.0,well it was nice talking to you too Jim
sw2015-ms98-a-trans,ula,49,6683,6722,39.0,2.0,oh goodness okay is our five minutes up
sw2015-ms98-a-trans,ula,50,2488,2577,89.0,2.0,i put a stop to some of them as far as the door-to-door either religious groups or people
sw2015-ms98-a-trans,ula,51,2603,2757,154.0,7.0,peddling products if i wanted their products i would've either gone to the store to bought it or i would've called for their salesman salesman to come out
sw2015-ms98-a-trans,ula,52,5759,5968,209.0,5.0,wonder if there'd be some way we could get these people that do this get their names their addresses and their phone numbers and then reverse it and do well that would be technically illegal it'd be harassment
sw2015-ms98-a-trans,ula,53,1818,2096,278.0,3.0,but if they're going to offer these services or these recorded message everything they ought to be stuck working with the phone book like everybody else instead of using a computer to go through and just go down every sequence of numbers for this certain area code and call them
sw2015-ms98-a-trans,ula,54,6001,6038,37.0,3.0,but i consider invasion of my privacy
sw2015-ms98-a-trans,ula,55,4988,5182,194.0,2.0,now the part about where you said the apartment complex puts up signs that says no soliciting i've even gone so far as to put that i've got a storm door on the front of the house and i've put in
sw2015-ms98-a-trans,ula,56,1657,1663,6.0,0.0,um-hum
sw2015-ms98-a-trans,ula,57,644,820,176.0,0.0,and you're trying to crawl out of a half unconscious sleep and answer the phone you either hear the click as soon as you say hello you hear the click of the recording coming on
sw2015-ms98-a-trans,ula,58,5719,5734,15.0,0.0,instead of stop
sw2015-ms98-a-trans,ula,59,3813,3996,183.0,6.0,pursue their religion of choice in that whatever manner they want to but i think they also should respect the sanctity of the American home whether it be in a house or in an apartment
sw2015-ms98-a-trans,ula,60,4634,4852,218.0,5.0,and i don't know i just um i just don't particularly care for that at all and that that's one thing that i feel really strongly about though is uh you know people coming up to my door especially religious organizations
sw2015-ms98-a-trans,ula,61,3252,3345,93.0,1.0,and i really hate that i really really do i had somebody come to the door about two weeks ago
sw2015-ms98-a-trans,ula,62,414,458,44.0,0.0,that is that one that you were talking about
sw2015-ms98-a-trans,ula,63,249,393,144.0,2.0,normally when they call you're either in the shower or you in the middle of cooking something and you had to stop everything to run to the phone
sw2015-ms98-a-trans,ula,64,4022,4118,96.0,6.0,i'm on my turf if i want them there i'll call for them otherwise i don't want to know they exist
sw2015-ms98-a-trans,ula,65,168,189,21.0,0.0,offering a service or
sw2015-ms98-a-trans,ula,66,2282,2349,67.0,2.0,so yeah i do i really feel that that's uh an invasion of my privacy
sw2015-ms98-a-trans,ula,67,2587,2593,6.0,0.0,um-hum
sw2015-ms98-a-trans,ula,68,1574,1647,73.0,0.0,we've got a thing in this country you can have your phone number unlisted
sw2015-ms98-a-trans,ula,69,5401,5598,197.0,5.0,yeah yeah that's true yeah no i don't uh i don't have i didn't go that far but uh yeah i probably could do the same thing uh you know i don't have a storm door but i'm sure i could rig up something

sw2025-ms98-a-trans.ascii-1-NEW,ula,6,4526,4714,188.0,0.0,uh but as far as the sentencing by the judge i would have to vote against that since there's a jury because that's what the juries are for is to make the decision um what are your feelings
sw2025-ms98-a-trans.ascii-1-NEW,ula,7,774,847,73.0,3.0,um but i think if we quit uh building these Taj Mahals with the color TVs

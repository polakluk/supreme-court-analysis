MR. DREEBEN: Yes. The drunken person who
creates panic and disruption and would be reasonably
interpreted as having uttered a threat under the
government's view is guilty. Under Mr. Elwood's
position in his brief, that individual would not be
because involuntary intoxication can negate specific
intent. It's Hornbook law that that is a defense.
Under the position that he's argued at the podium today
perhaps not, because voluntarily intoxication doesn't
necessarily negate knowledge.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm still not sure how yo
answered Justice Scalia's hypothetical and mine --
MR. DREEBEN: Let me try one more time.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: The threat is just
repeated --
MR. DREEBEN: That's right. The person who
repeats the threat --JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- with no bad purpose.
MR. DREEBEN: Let's say a newspaper prints
it on the front page. The newspaper is not expressing
its intent to -- or making a statement that reflects th
speaker's intent to inflict harm. What the threat is i
a statement that the speaker makes which on its face an
in context would be understood as an intent to inflict
harm. Repeating it doesn't have that characteristic.
And I think we discussed, Justice Kennedy,
that the jury instructions don't say that literally, bu
I think in context that's exactly how they were
understood.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you have -- if
you have a statement made in the style of rap music as
this one or several of these were, is the reasonable
person supposed to be someone familiar with that style
and the use of what might be viewed as threatening word
in connection with that music or is -- or not?
MR. DREEBEN: So, Mr. Chief Justice, it
depends on whom the speaker is speaking to. If the
person is speaking to --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: To a general
audience.
